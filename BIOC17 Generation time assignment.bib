  abstract = {Generation time varies widely across organisms and is an important factor in the life cycle, life history and evolution of organisms. Although the doubling time (DT) has been estimated for many bacteria in the laboratory, it is nearly impossible to directly measure it in the natural environment. However, an estimate can be obtained by measuring the rate at which bacteria accumulate mutations per year in the wild and the rate at which they mutate per generation in the laboratory. If we assume the mutation rate per generation is the same in the wild and in the laboratory, and that all mutations in the wild are neutral, an assumption that we show is not very important, then an estimate of the DT can be obtained by dividing the latter by the former. We estimate the DT for five species of bacteria for which we have both an accumulation and a mutation rate estimate. We also infer the distribution of DTs across all bacteria from the distribution of the accumulation and mutation rates. Both analyses suggest that DTs for bacteria in the wild are substantially greater than those in the laboratory, that they vary by orders of magnitude between different species of bacteria and that a substantial fraction of bacteria double very slowly in the wild.},

  abstract = {Synchronous cultures of Escherichia coli B were produced under various environmental conditions. Analysis of the cell number data permitted the characterization of the generation time distribution for these organisms and the estimation of the mother-daughter generation time correlation coefficients. For all growth conditions, the distribution of generation times was found to be symmetrical with a coefficient of variation of 0·22±0·02. The mother-daughter generation time correlation coefficient was significantly negative at doubling times between 40 and 64 min. However, the results for a culture growing in succinate medium at 37°C, which had a significantly greater generation time, yielded a correlation coefficient close to zero. Within the range of temperatures studied (26 to 37°C), no significant effect on the correlation coefficient was observed.},

  abstract = {The current study examines the effect of tannins and tannin extracts on the lag phase duration, growth rate, and generation time of Escherichia coli. Effects of castalagin, vescalagin, gallic acid, Colistizer, tannic acid as well as chestnut, mimosa, and quebracho extracts were determined on E. coli’s growth phases using the broth microdilution method and obtained by turbidimetric measurements. E. coli responds to the stress caused by the investigated antimicrobial agents with reduced growth rates, longer generation times, and extended lag phases. Prolongation of the lag phase was relatively small at low tannin concentrations, while it became more pronounced at concentrations above half the MIC. Moreover, for the first time, it was observed that lag time extensions follow a strict exponential relationship with increasing tannin concentrations. This feature is very likely a direct consequence of the tannin complexation of certain essential ions from the growth medium, making them unavailable to E. coli for its growth.},
